Starting from the python file openalex_citation_network.py, which builds an openalex citation network for climate science, create one or more new python files that use openalex topics instead of openalex concepts.  Structure the new files as  appropriate python objects.  
Please create a test file, test_openalex.py, modeled on test_openalex_network.py, with a single test, test_get_topic, modeled on the same named method in test_openalex_network.py.  For the new test, use monkeypatching for the OpenAlexClient._get method.  The monkeypatched method should return the contents of file sample_topic.json
Please add a method get_work to openalex.py, which retrieves an openalex Work, similar to the way get_topic retrieves an openalex Topic.  Add a test for get_work to test_openalex_network.py
Please create write_list as a method in class NetworkFileTalker in file network_file_talker.py. Given a list of objects, write_list writes each object in json format as one line to the file. Arguments to write_list: "object_list" is the list of objects; "filename" is the name of the file as a string. If the file exists, append the new lines to it. If the file does not exist, create it first and then write the lines. Create class TestNetworkFileTalker in file test_network_file_talker.py, with a test for write_file that reads the lines from sample_works_list.json as a list of json objects called input-list, uses write_file to write the objects to file “test-file”, then reads “test-file” to create a new list of objects called output-list. Assert that the lengths of input-list and output-list are the same, and that the id and display_name fields of the first object in each list are the same.
